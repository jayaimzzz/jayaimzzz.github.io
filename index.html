        <h2>Education</h2>
        <div>I studied Music Engineering Technology at Ball State a decade ago.</div>
        <div>My instrument was double bass.</div>

        <h2>That work life after college and before Kenzie.</h2>
        <div>After graduation, I transistion into a field that paid the bills better; commercial HVAC.</div>
        <div>I ventured outside of HVAC into many other similar constrution fields including:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>building decks</li>
            <li>hardwood
                <strong>floor</strong> installion</li>
            <li>
                <em>residential</em> HVAC (some may think residential is &lt; commercial but they're wrong.)</li>
        </ul>
        <div>I ran away to Denver for a few months and explored the crazy world of HVAC-<strong><em>R</em></strong>.</div>
        <div>I returned to Indiana to fix HVAC for an Amazon fullfilment warehouse.</div>
        <h2>Why I'm changing careers</h2>
        <p>I have always enjoyed computers and technology. During my time at Ball State, I briefly consideded adding CS as a
            double major.</p>
