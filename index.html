<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I studied Music Engineering Technology at Ball State a decade ago. My instrument was double bass.</p>
<h2>That work life after college and before Kenzie.</h2>
<p>After graduation, I transistion into a field that paid the bills better; commercial HVAC. I ventured outside of HVAC into many other similar constrution fields including building decks, hardwood floor installion, and even into residential HVAC.  I ran away to Denver for a few minutes and explored the crazy world of HVAC-R.  I returned to Indiana to fix HVAC for an Amazon fullfilment warehouse.</p>
<h2>Why I'm changing careers</h2>
<p>My aging body could not handle the physically demanding labor.  I have always enjoy computer and technology.  During my time at Ball State, I briefly consideded adding CS as a double major.</p>
